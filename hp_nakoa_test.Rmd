```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

1. Load packages and read in data
```{r, include = FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
hp_data = read_csv("harry_potter_aggression_full.csv")
```


I'm in lab week 6!

2. Basic wrangling and make a graph of Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy aggression rates
```{r}
hp_graph <- hp_data %>% 
  filter(Name == "Harry" | Name == "Draco Malfoy") %>% 
  select(Name, book, agg.per.mention) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = book, y = agg.per.mention)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = Name), position = "dodge") + # make cluster col graph vs stacked
  labs(x = "Book", y = "Aggressive Acts Per Mention") +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_bw()

hp_graph
```
